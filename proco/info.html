    <h1>ProCo Information</h1>
    <h1>General Info</h1>
    <h3>Team Registration</h3>
    <p>Teams can have between one and three students. Students on a team do not need to be in the same grade, or have
        the same level of programming experience. If the registration limit is exceeded, we will allocate slots to
        ensure fair representation of all interested schools based on the following policy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Teams belonging to the same school are ordered by time of registration.</li>
        <li>Each school's #1 team will be registered, then each school's #2 team, and so on until all spaces are
            allocated.</li>
        <li>Teams consisting solely of students from the same school will be given higher priority than teams consisting
            of students from different schools.</li>
        <li>If we reach our participation cap, any remaining teams will be placed on a wait list, and they will be
            notified as soon as possible if spots become available.
            You will be able to modify your team until one week before contest day (you can only add team members from
            the same school unless the waitlist is empty). Modification requests should be submitted by email. After
            this deadline, the only team change you will be allowed to make is dropping members.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note that walk-ins are strictly not allowed. Students who try to register onsite on the day of the event
        will be asked to leave.</p>
    <h3>Divisions</h3>
    <p>There are two different divisions in the competition: Novice and Advanced. A team may compete in the Novice
        division only if all members have less than two years of programming experience. All teams may compete in the
        Advanced division.</p>
    <h3>Laptops and Equipment</h3>
    <p>Each team is required to bring a laptop with wireless capabilities (802.11b). You should also bring laptop power
        cables and extension cords to guarantee power throughout the contest. If you do not bring extension cords, we
        cannot guarantee access to power outlets.</p>
    <p>Each team is restricted to the use of only one laptop. No external screen/monitor, keyboard, or mouse is allowed.
    </p>
    <p>For the speed round, Javascript support is required, and the supported browsers are Firefox 59, Safari 8 (for OS
        X Yosemite), Chrome 58, Opera 19.0, and Microsoft Edge. Optimal browsing experience will be achieved with
        Firefox, Safari, or Chrome.</p>
    <h3>Food</h3>
    <p>Lunch (pizza) will be provided. If you do not wish to eat pizza, please bring your own lunch.</p>
    <h3>Prizes</h3>
    <p>Cool prizes will be awarded to the highest-scoring teams and vary year to year. Previous first place prizes have
        included Raspberry Pis, iPad Minis and Nintendo 3DSes.</p>
    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <h3>Access and Communication</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Each team is allowed to use a single laptop with Internet access. No external screen/monitor or keyboard is
            allowed.</li>
        <li>Internet access may only be used for browsing documentation. Browsing any other website is prohibited. The
            allowed sites are the following:<ul>

                <li><a href="http://cppreference.com/">http://cppreference.com/</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If other sites for documentation are desired, they must be pre-approved by a member of the ProCo staff</li>
        <li>The use of external code or pre-writted code is prohibited.</li>
        <li>External communication is prohibited.</li>
        <li>The only programs allowed are IDE, editors, web browsers, and programming tools. The use of all other
            programs are prohibited.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Input and Output</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All input will be received from console input (System.in in Java, cin in C++, stdin in C, sys.stdin in
            Python 2.7).</li>
        <li>All output should be sent to console output (System.out in Java, cout in C++, stdout in C, sys.stdout in
            Python 2.7).</li>
        <li>Each program will specify its own output format. Format all output as closely as possible to the
            specifications. This includes spacing, capitalization, and punctuation. See below for examples for input and
            output.<ul>
                <li>Java
                    <img alt="Java IO" src="java-io.png" />
                </li>
                <li>C++
                    <img alt="C++ IO" src="cpp-io.png" />
                </li>
                <li>C
                    <img alt="C IO" src="c-io.png" />
                </li>
                <li>Python 2.7
                    <img alt="Python 2.7 IO" src="python2.7-io.png" />
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Submissions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We will be accepting submissions in C, C++, Java, Python 2.7, and Python 3.6.</li>
        <li>Solutions will be graded using GNU C++11, Java 1.8.0, Python 2.7, and Python 3.6 on Linux machines.</li>
        <li>All files must be named in the format specified on your problem statement. File extensions must be the
            following:<ul>
                <li>C: problem.c</li>
                <li>C++: problem.cc or problem.cpp</li>
                <li>Java: problem.java</li>
                <li>Python: problem.py</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Java submissions must follow these rules:<ul>
                <li>Name of the main class should be the task name.</li>
                <li>All classes should be in one file.</li>
                <li>Don't include a package statement.</li>
                <li>Avoid using scanner for efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You will be submitting your (single) code file to us using a web interface. If you are using Java and want
            to create multiple classes, put all of the class declarations into one file.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Speed Round (Round 1)</h3>
    <p>The speed round duration will be 2 hours and will consist of 8-10 unweighted problems.</p>
    <p>Submissions will be run on a set of test cases which are not revealed to the teams during the contest, and they
        are accepted as correct if they pass on all of the test cases. Teams will be notified whether their submission
        is correct within about a minute. If the submission is correct, no further points can be awarded for the
        problem. If the submission is not accepted, teams are free to resubmit the problem. There is no penalty for
        incorrect submissions and no limit on the number of submissions per problem.</p>
    <p>The submissions from a team do not all need to be in the same language. For example, the same team could solve
        novA in C, novD in Java, and novF in C++.</p>
    <h3>Scoring</h3>
    <p>Teams are ranked according to the most problems solved. Teams who solve the same number of problems will be
        ranked in accordance with the earliest time of their last correct submission.</p>
    <h3>Special Round (Round 2)</h3>
    <p>The special round duration will be 2 hours. More rules and scoring details are dependent on the year.</p>

        are for training purposes and will be harder than the problems given. Recommended links (similar format or
