            <h3>What is this?</h3>
            Like a cross between an escape room and MIT-style puzzle hunts.
            Teams race across campus solving creative puzzles and trying to put together the answer to a murder mystery.
            <!-- You will be given puzzles at each location and submit answers via an app. If you have trouble, we‚Äôll be on-site to help out! -->
            <br/>
            <b>No prior experience is needed.</b>
            <br/>
