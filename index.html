  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>ACM is Stanford’s premier computer science organization. We are a community of passionate students who build exciting projects to learn about and solve challenging technical and social problems. Over time, self-starting individuals have created an enduring culture evidenced by a wide-range of ACM projects in recent years -- most notably YouTube Instant, the predecessor to YouTube’s current autocomplete feature, as well as the technology behind acquired startups Fancy That (Palantir, 2015) and PeerCDN (Yahoo, 2013).</p>
